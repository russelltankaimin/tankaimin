## Professional and Interpersonal

### Leadership
I was often thrust into leadership positions ever since primary school. I have been the class monitor thrice in school, a Vice President of a CCA and team lead for a software project.

### Communication
Apart from having experience facilitating team communication, I am also proficient in giving pitches and delivering ideas in a suitable fashion, be it for techical or layman use. I also strive to give constructive feedback to others should the need arises.

### Organisational
Being the leader, I chair and facilitate the meetings and check on the progress of everyone around me. I am also usually in charge of distributing work in a fair manner according to my team member's strengths, weaknesses and intended learning outcomes.

### Research
I have and am still currently doing academic research with several top institutions in Singapore like DSO National Laboratories and National University of Singapore. I have also conducted research at the industry level with the Seagate Research Group.

### Teaching
I have started teaching since O Levels where I tutored students in Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics. I have also conducted tuition for Mathematics whilst balancing my time at University as well.
