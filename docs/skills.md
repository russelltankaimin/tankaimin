### Communication
Apart from having experience facilitating team communication, I am also proficient in giving pitches and delivering ideas in a suitable fashion, be it for techical or layman use. I also strive to give constructive feedback to others should the need arises.

### Organisational
Being the leader, I chair and facilitate the meetings and check on the progress of everyone around me. I am also usually in charge of distributing work in a fair manner according to my team member's strengths, weaknesses and intended learning outcomes.

### Research
I have and am still currently doing academic research with several top institutions in Singapore like DSO National Laboratories and National University of Singapore. I have also conducted research at the industry level with the Seagate Research Group.

### Teaching
