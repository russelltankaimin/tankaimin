# Stocks, Bonds and Forwards

## Stocks  
- Issued by firms to finance operations
- Represent ownership of the firm
- Prices known today, but not the future
- May or may not pay dividends

## Bonds
- Price known today
- Future payoffs known at fixed dates
- Otherwise, price movement is random
- Final payoff at maturity
- Intermediate payoffs : coupons
- Exposed to default/credit risk

## Derivatives
- Sell for a price/value/premium today
- Future value derived from the value of the underlying securities
- Traded at exchanges - standardised contracts, no credit risk or over the counter (a network of dealers, institutions, can be non-standard)
- Some credit risk

### Why derivatives?
- To hedge risk
- To speculate
- To attain "arbitrage" profit
- To exchange one type of payoff for another
- To circumvent regulations

## Forward (Contract)
- An agreement to buy (long) or sell (short) a given underlying asset S at a predetermined future date T (maturity) at a predetermined price F (forward price)
- F is chosen so that the contract has zero value today
- Delivery takes place at T 
- Payoff : S(T) - F or F - S(T)
- S(T) := spot market price at maturity


## Swaps
- Agreement between 2 parties to exchange 2 series of payments
- E.g paying fixed interest rate patments
