# My Study Plan at NUS
Below, I list all the potential classes that I am interested, and may take in the whatever remaining semesters I have. For friends or juniors visiting and wanting to take classes with me , you may refer to this page but do note, plans are not fixed as schedules change every academic year.


Depending on CourseReg outcomes, plans will also change but I will update this as much as possible but it will not be so often
