# My Coursework at NUS
These are some of the courses that I have completed or are currently studying in NUS as part of my Double Degree Programme. Juniors may take a look and perhaps decide what to take at any point of your studies. Please do note that this plan is dependent on individual abilities and time management.

**NOTE**: CP3209 and GEN2002X are year long courses, of 8 units and 4 units respectively. It is assumed that 4 units (respectively 2 units) are taken per semester in a single year for CP3209 (resp. GEN2002X)
