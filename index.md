# This is Russell's Github-hosted Site

## About this Site
This is a simple site which hosts the basic information from my original site [Russell Site](www.russelltankm.com). In the event the site goes down, this will be the go-to spot if you need anything from me.

## About Russell
I am a Computer Science and Mathematics Double Degree Programme (DDP) student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) with 7 years of playing around with tech. In my spare time, I watch movies, read comics and a good mix of mystery, adventure novels and take long hikes.

I have general interests in Algorithms, A.I and Machine Learning and its applications to Cryptography. My future career goal is to research and build applications which are fun, exciting and useful for others, specifically in trying to bring research software into production.
