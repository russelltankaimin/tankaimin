# This is Russell's ~~Github-hosted~~ personal site.

## About this Site
This is a simple site ~~which hosts the basic information from my original site [Russell Site](www.russelltankm.com). In the event the site goes down, this will be the go-to spot if you need anything from me.~~ I used to have a personal website built using React.js and supported by a GraphQL database but that has been archived.

## About Russell
![image](images/my_beautiful_face.jpg){: style="float: left; margin: 10px; max-width: 50%; height: auto;"}  

Singaporean Chinese Male, aged (last 3 digits of the current year), student. I am studying Computer Science and Mathematics as a Double Degree Student (DDP) in NUS. It is a 5-year programme (which can be completed within 4 with enough overloading - though that is not my plan). Prior to university, I studied at Victoria Junior College for my GCE A-Levels where I spent most of my time delving into various domains in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I have general interests in Computer Science Theory, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Some topics I have delved with are **Logic, SAT Solving, Cryptography, Number Theory and Group Theory and Optimisation Problems**. I hope to work on Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimisation problems in the future, be it in industry or research. I am also interested in contributing to research software and various software engineering projects that utilises academic tools.
