These are the projects that I did in school and during vacation.

## AlphaSAT
*May 2024 - Present*
It is an A.I SAT Solver, still at the conceptualisation and research phase. This is expected to take many years given this is my own pet project. I am not releasing anymore details since it is a WIP.

## Personal Website (Russell-Site)
*June 2016 - June 2023*
My personal website where I post stuff and possibly host (my own) software too.
### Description:
This is V1.4 of my personal website. My first website was built solely using Google Sites, V1.2 is built using solely HTML/CSS, V1.3 has Javascript added to be more dynamic. Now I am using React.JS, BootStrap with a GraphQL database as a backend for certain portions. There is also a possible addition of a Java Spring Boot backend during the summer provided I can find a hosting site for it. I have tried to connect PostgreSQL, MySQL but decided that GraphQL is the most appropriate for my site.

## EduMate
*February 2023 - April 2023*
A Contact Book where you can schedule meet up and locations with your friends and other contacts
### Description:
This project is done as a team project for CS2103T (Software Engineering). I do not usually post schoolwork here but the scale of this project relative to our peer's submission deserves it position in this page. Everyone in the team got above A- for this module despite having > 30k LoC.

## PlanNUS
*April 2022 - September 2022*
Engineered an Android Application to help NUS Freshmen organise schedules.
### Description:
Built features include : To-Do List, Dashboard, Timetable Generator built using Microsoft Z3 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theoris) Solver which is hosted on a Heroku Backend. My team was awarded the highest level of achievement for this project.

## MeasureText
*March 2020 - April 2020*
Built a simple multi-class classification model that deduces the authorship of several essays of the Federalist Papers.
### Description:
Built using Sci-kit Learn and Pandas to extract features using a parser that I built to construct my own dataset of features which are scrapped from the other essays that have known authorship.

## Sum of 3 Palindromes
*Jan 2020 - March 2020*
Built a Python program which helps to express any number of base >= 5 into a sum of 3 palindromes.
### Description:
This is implemented according to the algorithm provided by a paper from Javier Cilleruelo, Florian Luca and Lewis Baxter, titled : EVERY POSITIVE INTEGER IS A SUM OF 3 PALINDROMES. Even though Christian Lawson Perfect has done one for base-10 integers and Lewis Baxter has done an applet for base 5-10 integers, I thought of implementing one that encompasses numbers of bases 5-16 ...YES, INCLUDING HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS as well.
